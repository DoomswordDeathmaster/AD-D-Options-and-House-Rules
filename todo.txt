Xadd fights as and saves as to npc records
when dragging to the ct, set matrix values
Xmake combat matrix editable
X auto-set combat matrix
set saves from save as

	X char_matrix not being called
	Xcharcter vs npc still calls createthacomatrix and the fights_as stuff
	Xmatrix on edit page should be editable
	Xcreatures without fights_as set, receiving all 20s in char_matrix?


Xcheck moduledb nodes for correct edits

Xwhen opening combat calc, values in main matrix change to originals but secondary matrix is correct





TEST THIS
rules
	if fights_as is set, always take it
		if db value is set, always take it
		else take the default matrix based on hd


TODO
try to figure out if I need these super calls inside inline scripts



Xadvancement tiers seem to have all 20s

set saves and fights when value in main changes?
