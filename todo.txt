Xadd fights as and saves as to npc records
?when dragging to the ct, set matrix values
Xmake combat matrix editable
X auto-set combat matrix
Xset saves from save as

	X char_matrix not being called
	Xcharcter vs npc still calls createthacomatrix and the fights_as stuff
	Xmatrix on edit page should be editable
	Xcreatures without fights_as set, receiving all 20s in char_matrix?


Xcheck moduledb nodes for correct edits

Xwhen opening combat calc, values in main matrix change to originals but secondary matrix is correct





TEST THIS
Xrules
	if fights_as is set or fightsashdlevel is set, always take it
		if db value is set, always take it
		else take the default matrix based on hd


TODO
try to figure out if I need these super calls inside inline scripts



Xadvancement tiers seem to have all 20s

Xset saves and fights when value in main changes?



test 1-1 and 1+1 HD, etc
move amatrixrolls decision-making to manager file so we're not repeating code
